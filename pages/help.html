                What is this?

            <div class="content">
                <p>This app can read and write to a GNUCash MySQL database using a PHP script I wrote (explained below).</p>
                <p>The PHP script needs to be accessible over the internet and the script needs to be able to access the MySQL database that you want to use (usually localhost).</p>
                <p>I have the PHP script running on a debian-based VPS with the MySQL server accessed through a VPN (OpenVPN), works great!</p>

                So where is this PHP script?

                <div class="ui raised segment" id="php-location"><a>Tap here to copy the PHP script to your device so you can copy it to your web server.</a></div>
                <p>Updates to the PHP script are packaged with updates to this app. The app will let you know when to update the PHP script.</p>

                I don&rsquo;t understand this accounting voodoo...
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In accounting, money comes from one account and goes to another. For example, when you get paid, money comes from an income account and goes to your bank account</p>
                <p>Likewise, when you buy something, money comes from your credit card/bank and goes to an expense account, like dining.</p>
                <p><b>Reconciling</b></p>
                <p>Once transactions are posted/cleared (not pending), compare the amount that your statement shows for the transaction with the amount you entered into GNUCash. If you need to adjust the amount, do so. Once everything matches, reconcile it. If the dates are off by more than a few days, you should adjust the date as well. It helps in the future if you need to lookup a transaction.</p>
                <p>In the <u>View Account</u> page, <span class="red">red</span> transactions are not reconciled. In the <u>Overview</u> page, accounts in <span class="red">red</span> have unreconciled transactions.</p>

                What is this app made with?
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This app is built using Cordova, Semantic UI, jQuery using Visual Studio Community 2015.</p>
                <p>The source code is available, just email me if you want it at justin.hunt1223@gmail.com. I will post it to github soon when I get my life in order.</p>
